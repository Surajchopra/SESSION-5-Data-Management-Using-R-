SESSION 5: Data Management Using R 
Assignment 2 

 
1. obtain the elements of the union between two character 
vectors. 
vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,])) vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[10:32,])) 

Answer:
union(vec1, vec2)


2. Get those elements that are common to both vectors 
vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,])) vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[10:32,])) 

Answer:
intersect(vec1, vec2)


3. Get the difference of the elements between two 
character vectors. 
vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,])) vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[10:32,])) 

Answer: 

setdiff(vec1, vec2)

4. Test the equality of two character vectors 
vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,])) vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[11:25,])) 

Answer:

setequal(vec1, vec2)

Output: False.
