SESSION 5: Data Management Using R 
Assignment 3 

1. Test whether two vectors are exactly equal (element by 
element) 
vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,])) vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[11:25,])) 

Answer:

identical(vec1, vec2)

Output:
FALSE


2. Sort the character vector in ascending order and descending 
order 
vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,])) vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[11:25,])) 

Answer:

for ascending order: 

sort(vec1)


for descending order:

sort(vec2, decreasing=TRUE)


3. What is the major difference between str c() and paste() 
show an example. 

Answer:
There is not much difference in paste() and str_c() function. 

1. paste( ) and paste0( ) are both function from the base package whereas str_c ( ) comes from Stringr package. 
2. Paste function in R is used to concatenate Vectors by converting them into character. Str_ c () function is used to join mutiple strings into a single string. And Str_c () is faster. 

Example of Str_c()

str_c("letters", letters, sep = ":")

paste("letters", letters, sep = ":")

4. Introduce a separator when concatenating the strings 

Answer:

paste("this is best", sep = "-")
cat("this is best", sep = "-")
